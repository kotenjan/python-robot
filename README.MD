This program uses docker-compose to build an environment to communicate with Pepper robot manufactured by SoftBank robotics. The robot builds a tower from objects laying in front of it. Here is a short [video](datafiles/demo.mp4) demonstrating this ability. A simulator for the manipulation with the robotic arm can be found in a [demo](testing.ipynb) notebook. 

For the program to work, you are going to need the full version of Naoqi SDK which needs to be named python-sdk.tar.gz and inserted in .devcontainer/builder
